# MannAAdd2Numbers

Peer Reviewed by : Brandon Le - Program works as intended with no issues. I was able to get the sum of the numberinos that I inputted. I was able to loop to the beginning by typing y and ending by typing n. All of the data validation worked properly for the user inputs and also the play again/end function. Simple, straight to the point and good work! Very nice.
